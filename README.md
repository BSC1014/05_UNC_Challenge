## Overview: 
***
* This project was designed to allow decision makers to better understand fares and fare trends by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). This was done by computing two sets of analysis as follows: 
    - First an analysis was done to combine both city and ride data to summarize the ride specifics by city type such as total tides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride, and average fares per driver. 
    - Second an analysis was done to visualize the total weekly fares for each type of city to better understand how time of year effects fares.     


## Results: 
***
* For step one the results of the summary analysis were as follows:

    - A few key items stand out based on this summary. 
        - First, Urban areas have the highest number of rides and drives, as expected, but there is much less opportunity from a diver standpoint as there is nearly 2X times as many drivers as rides. Additionally, the average fare per rider and per driver is lower, probably due to the shorter distances traveled in an urban environment. 
        - Second, rural areas offer the highest driver earnings as there are less drivers than rides and the average fare paid and average fair earned per driver is higher than all other city types, likely do to higher distances traveled.  
* For step two the results of the visualized trip trends were as follows:

    - A few key items stand out based on this visualization. 
        - Fares tended to be correlated across the board with all city types showing similar peeks and valleys, note peek shared across all types in the third week of February. 
        - Urban fares were more volatile having sharper peeks and valleys than the other data types, note the urban period from late February to April as compared to the other city types. 


## Summary: 
***
* Based on the results of this analysis I would would recommend the following: 
    - First, although the rural areas offered the highest fares per driver, if more drivers are added to the region there is a high likelihood that the market could become too saturated given the low overall trade counts. Therefore I would not recommend adding drivers to this city type. 
    - Second, fares across all regions did not display any seasonality, as a result, it would not make sense to pull drivers from say an urban area and put them in a suburban area at specific times of the year. 
    - Lastly, I would recommend that from a business growth standpoint, the area with the biggest opportunity from a driver standpoint is suburban areas. Suburban areas offer significant demand compared to rural areas, while also still have more demand from a ride side, with less total drivers than rides. Suburban areas also offer a solid per ride fare as the distances are longer than urban areas. Also, although no city type displayed conclusive seasonality, suburban fares were less volatile throughout the year than urban fares.
