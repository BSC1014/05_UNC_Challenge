## Overview Explain the purpose of the new analysis.
***
* This project was designed to allow decision makers to better understand fares and fare trends by city type (Rural, Suburban, and Urban). This was done by computing two sets of analysis as follows: 
    - First an analysis was done to combine both city and ride data to summarize the ride specifics by city type such as total tides, total drivers, total fares, average fares per ride, and average fares per driver. 
    - Second an analysis was done to visualize the total weekly fares for each type of city to better understand how time of year effects fares.     


## Results Using images from the summary DataFrame and multiple-line chart, describe the differences in ride-sharing data among the different city types.
***
* For step one the results of the summary analysis were as follows:

Additionally, the average fare per rider and per driver is lower, probably due to the shorter distances traveled in an urban environment. 
        - Second, rural areas 


## Summary Based on the results, provide three business recommendations to the CEO for addressing any disparities among the city types.
